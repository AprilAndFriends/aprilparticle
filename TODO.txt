* implement basic emitter and basic particle
* emitter
	* emitter surface -> plane used to randomly generate snow for example
	* emitter affectors
	* child particles
	* particles can also be emitters -> for example: an missile(mesh  particle) exploding into small chunks(mesh particle) and smoke&fire(billboard)
	* ...
* particle
	* billboard
	* mesh
	* voxel
	* trail
	* ...
* affectors
	* force
		* whirlwind
		* gravity
		* wind (randomized force influence during lifetime of particles)
	* motor
	* blocker
	* explode (used with generated particles to simulate explosions)
	* ...
